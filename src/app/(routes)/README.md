# (routes) Route group

Route group for QTS Dashboard. Does not affect the URL path. Contains:

- **routes/** – Routes management (`/routes`)
- **tasks/** – Tasks management (`/tasks`)
- **alerts/** – Alerts view (`/alerts`)
- **analytics/** – Analytics view (`/analytics`)

All these pages share the same layout (sidebar + main content) via `layout.tsx` in this folder.
